# Pet Management APP: Django and Angular

## About the App
This application allows registering new pets, looking at existing ones, consulting pets by name, as well as seeing each pet's age.
<br>
<br>

### Register new pets:
User must define the new pet name and the pet's date of birth.

Not sure about the pet's birthdate?
Just check the aproximated checkbox! we will keep track of it.
<br>
<br>

### Remove existing pets
Want to remove pets from our registry ? 
Just hit the trash icon for that pet.
<br>
<br>

### For Developers
The backend of this APP is done with Python, using Django framework.
The UI is built with Angular.
The app is dockerized for easy portability.
<br>
<br>

### Things to Improve:
It would be great to make use of Reactive Forms instead of Template Driven forms.
Pet registration could be improved, adding validation to the pet name, like the max length it allows. It woyuld be nice to add the max date allowed for the pet's birthdate. (the app currently allows a pet to be registered with a date greater than today, which makes no sense at all)
